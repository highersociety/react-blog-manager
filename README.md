# React Blog Post Manager

# Overview

This is a simple blog post manager built with **React** for the **Phase 2 Code Challenge**. It demonstrates how to manage state, pass props between components, and structure a clean and functional React application.

Users can:
- View a list of blog posts
- Add new blog posts
- Delete existing blog posts

Everything is managed using **React functional components** and **hooks** like `useState`.



# Technologies Used

- React (with Hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (basic styling)
- Node.js & npm (to run the project)
